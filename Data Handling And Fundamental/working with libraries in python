Python library is a collection of functions and methods that allows you to perform many actions without writing your code. For example, the Python imaging library (PIL).is one of the core libraries for image manipulation in Python. Pillow is an actively developed fork of PIL. Open-CV Python is a library of Python (also binds to C++, C# etc.) aimed at real-time computer vision and image processing. It makes use of Numpy, another library for numerical operations.

Each library in Python contains a huge number of useful modules that you can import for your every day programming.

There are 20 Python Libraries that you cannot live without:

Requests.           HTTP library.
Scrapy.             For web scraping.
