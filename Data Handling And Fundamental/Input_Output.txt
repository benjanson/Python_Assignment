Reading Input From the Keyboard
Programs often need to obtain data from the user, usually by way of input from the keyboard. The simplest way to accomplish this in Python is with input().

input("")

Reads a line of input from the keyboard.

input() pauses program execution to allow the user to type in a line of input from the keyboard. Once the user presses the Enter key, all characters typed are read and returned as a string:

>>> s = input()   #Input
foo bar baz
>>> s
'foo bar baz'

Output 
A program will also usually need to present data back to the user. You can display program data to the console in Python with print().

>>> s = input()
foo bar baz
>>> s
'foo bar baz'  #Output
