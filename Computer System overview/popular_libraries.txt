There are many libraries in python some of the popular libraries are NumPy, Supy, Pandas,.....
    
    NumPy: It supprts many multi-dimenstional array and matrices, along with large collection of Hign-Level Mathematical Functions to operate on theses arrays. Numpy is free and open source  and has many contributers.
    
    Scipy: Its a scientific library for python is an open source, This library depends on NumPy, which provides convinent and multi-dimensional array manipulation. The main reason for building SciPy library is to work with NumPy arrays. Its user friendly and efficient in performing tasks with SciPy library. 
    The specail about this library is that it has biuild in special mathematical library like: 
                        > Cubic Root Function
                        > Exponential Function
                        > Relative Error Exponential Function
                        > Log Sum Exponential Function
                        > Lambert Function
                        > Permutations and Combinations Function
                        > Gamma Function
                        
   Pandas: Pandas is also a free and open source. Its rich in libraries like providing high-perfomance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis for python.
   It is used is wide range of fields including academic and commercial domains including finance, economics, Statistics, Analysis, etc.
   The best part is if you have worked previously on other libraries like NumPy it is such easy.
