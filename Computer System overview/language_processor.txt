#Language_processor

A language processor is a software program used to perform tasks such like -> program code to machine code.
it translates the High_Level Language(source codes) to Low_Level(machine codes)

|There are different types of language processors:
    ~COMPILER
    ~ASSEMBLER
    ~INTERPRETER

Compiler:
     A compiler is a language processor which translate source code from high level language into binary machine code .

Assembler:
    An assembler translates from a low level language to binary machine code.

Interpreter:
    An interpreter is different from compiler and assembler . It does not convert program into machine code format instead ot directs the CPU to obey each program statement .
    
AFTER THAT:
    The Hardware perfomrs the task as the given instructions.
